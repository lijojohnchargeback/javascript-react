/* 
Protop type
   constructor function = you want add one property. It will be avaialbe only one object instance. If you want to all object
   functonname.prototype.property name
   Mobile.pototype.color
   Instance member and proto type member
   instance meber means console.log you can see directly called but prorpty member proto me 
   javascritpt bottom to top approach
   iterate all object keyws Object keys will not work. We have to for in loop
   name.objectpro = ""
   This only work for one instance. 
   if you want all instances Objectname.prototype.color = "dfalk"'
   instance member and proptype member

   Object.key only show property. It will not proto type. for in looop will show all properyt


   in javascript object is associated with object
   Every object has parent Object prototype
   b2 is an object = this is array prototype. This array is proto type of object. This object is null. Proptype always starts with null

   if you create any function there are two function associated with it funciton and protype funciton
   Every object is object.proto type 

 Whenever create new a new object is being created in javascript engine  and directly connected to proto-type

 Prototype chain
   - 

Proto-types
   -Prototype is mechanism in javascript by which javascript inherit properities and methods from another object.
